--- Hidden Crocs ---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by Crocs, the company

Shoes inspired by Crocs' iconic Classic Clog have been scattered across Terraria - From the Glowing Mushroom Biome to the Crimson, they are everywhere! 
Hiding in the brightest caves and most hidden crevices - find them & unlock special buffs no other gear can offer.

Each Croc has two different modes, toggled by "Sports Mode".
This mode will have different functionality when on or off, such as increased damage, modified movement, or even completely unique effects.

Finally, the Glimmering Jibbitz is a global Croc buff obtained by shimmering any Croc (but the two evil variants), which has its own additional effects.

Each Croc is found randomly or naturally throughout the world.
