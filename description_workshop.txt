--- Hidden Crocs ---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by & for Croc's Croctober celebration

Hidden Crocs adds 13 new Croc accessories throughout the world with wildly varying effects.
From the Simple Crocs, which simply allow slightly faster mining, or the Granite Crock, which gives you a glowing Croc Elemental which glows -
there's a lot of things these can do.

Furthermore, each Croc has two different mode, toggled by "Sports Mode". 
This mode will have different functionality when on or off, such as increased damage, modified movement, or even completely unique effects.

Finally, the Glimmering Jibbitz is a global Croc buff obtained by shimmering any Croc (but the two evil variants), which has its own additional effects.

Each Croc is found randomly or naturally throughout the world.
